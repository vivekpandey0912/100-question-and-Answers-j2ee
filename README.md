Below are 100 Java EE (J2EE) interview questions and answers. Please note that Java EE has evolved into Jakarta EE, but many of the concepts remain relevant. 

1. What is Java EE (J2EE)?
Java EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) is a set of specifications, APIs, and technologies for building large-scale, distributed, and secure enterprise applications in Java.

2. What are the key components of Java EE?
Java EE includes components like Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans), JMS (Java Message Service), JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), JTA (Java Transaction API), JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface), etc.

3. What is the difference between Java SE and Java EE?
Java SE (Standard Edition) provides core Java libraries and runtime for desktop and standalone applications. Java EE extends Java SE with additional APIs and features for enterprise applications.

4. Explain the architecture of Java EE applications.
Java EE applications follow a multi-tiered architecture, typically divided into Presentation layer, Business layer, and Data layer (Persistence layer).

5. What is a Servlet?
A Servlet is a Java program that runs on the server and processes HTTP requests. It generates dynamic web content and manages the session state.

6. What is a JSP?
JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology that allows embedding Java code into HTML pages to dynamically generate web content.

7. What is an EJB?
EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) is a server-side component used for building distributed, scalable, and transactional enterprise applications.

8. What is a JMS?
JMS (Java Message Service) is an API for asynchronous messaging between applications using messages (e.g., queues and topics).

9. What is JPA?
JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that allows Java objects to be persisted to a relational database.

10. What is JDBC?
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API for connecting and interacting with relational databases in Java applications.

11. What is JTA?

An application server is a server that hosts Java EE applications and provides services like database connectivity, transaction management, etc.

16. Explain the Singleton design pattern and its use in Java EE.
The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to that instance. In Java EE, it is used to manage stateless EJBs to share a single instance across multiple clients.

17. What are the different types of EJBs?
Java EE defines three types of EJBs: Stateless Session Beans, Stateful Session Beans, and Message-Driven Beans.

A message-driven bean is an EJB used for processing JMS messages asynchronously.

20. Explain the concept of Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) in Java EE.
IoC is a design principle where the control of object creation and lifecycle management is shifted from the application code to a container. DI is a technique used to inject dependencies into a class rather than creating them inside the class.
